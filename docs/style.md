# Style

In terms of programming style, we have a few guidelines:
 - KISS (Keep it simple, stupid!)
 - Avoid custom CSS styles
 - DRY (Don't repeat yourself). For example, if you use a long list of Tailwind classes multiple times, then try making a CSS class that combines them. Check out `docs/developing#Combining Long Class Lists` for more info.
 - When in doubt, ask someone.

A few simple style *rules*:
 - Use backticks (`) for string literals. 
 - Use the function keyword when defining functions. Use arrow functions for callbacks.
