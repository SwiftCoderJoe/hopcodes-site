# Developing for Hopcodes-Site

Want to start working on the HopCodes website? You've come to the right place! Reading this doc should get you up and running quickly.

## Project Architecture

The project's file structure is organized like this:

```
hopcodes-site/
├── docs/
│   └── Documentation goes here
├── src/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── main.css
│   └── examplepage/
│       ├── index.html
│       └── main.css
├── dist/
│   └── Minified files generated by building the project appear here
└── config files, readme, etc.
```

While main.css is shown for each page, you should aim to not include any bespoke CSS outside of what is already offered by Tailwind. This will help keep the website consistent.

## Live Server

A live server can be started using:

`npm run dev`

This page will automatically refresh if any changes are made to the website.

## Building and Distributing

Building can be done by running:

`npm run build`

This will generate a single-page web app in `dist/`. This version is minified and is suitable for public distribution.

## Branching

Each time you want to add a new feature, please create a branch with a discriptive title. Feel free to create a draft pull request right away. When you're done, submit a pull request and ideally wait for someone to review and OK it.
